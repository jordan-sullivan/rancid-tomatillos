# Rancid Tomatillos : Movie Viewer

For this project, the goal of was to create a React application that allows users to browse through a collection of movies and see what peaks their interest. They may also sort movies from best to worst by rating, and vise versa with the click of a button. Users can click on a specific movie from the home page and the movie's details will render to a second page. The user can use the functional back arrow or click the Home button to return to the home page.
